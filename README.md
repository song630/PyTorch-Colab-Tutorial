# PyTorch-Colab-Tutorial
Get your PyTorch project running on Google Colab!
1. If you want to review the Jupyter Notebook file showed in the talk, it is `DLSession.ipynb` under `Colab Notebooks`;
2. The first demo is in `test2`;
3. The second demo is in `test3`;
4. I have removed the `.pth` files (too large to upload), so you may have to train your own before prediction; also remember to modify the paths inside source files;
- Test1: A simple FCN implementation on PASCAL-VOC-2007.
- Test2: A classification network using CNN & ResNet on CIFAR-10.
- Test3: A classfication & localization network on CUB-200-2011.
